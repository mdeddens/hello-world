# hello-world
Hello GitHub!

My name is Mimi, and I am a student at the University of Pennsylvania! New to GitHub, and using this
repository to get acquainted with the platform. I am excited to get to work and see all of the projects
my fellow coders--or "nerds," as my friends call us--come up with!
